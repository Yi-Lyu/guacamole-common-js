# guacamole-common-js

The Guacamole project provides a JavaScript API for interfacing with other components that conform to the design of Guacamole, such as projects using libguac or guacamole-common. This API is called guacamole-common-js.

guacamole-common-js provides a JavaScript implementation of a Guacamole client, as well as tunneling mechanisms for getting protocol data out of JavaScript and into guacd or the server side of a web application.

For convenience, it also provides mouse and keyboard abstraction objects that translate JavaScript mouse, touch, and keyboard events into consistent data that Guacamole can more easily digest. The extendable on-screen keyboard that was developed for the Guacamole web application is also included.
